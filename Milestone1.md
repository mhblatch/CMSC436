# Milestone 1
Accomplished:
* Created basic app skeleton
* Created initial home page
   * Simply has a title and shows any review that the user posts
* Created review page
   * User is allowed to type a 200 character review, pick a bar from a preset list using a Picker, and select a star rating
   * The star rating feature works now by allowing user to tap on any of the 5 stars and have it update correctly
   * Users can then either hit the submit review button or cancel.
      * Submit button: Adds the review (bar, description, star rating) to the home screen in a list format
      * Cancel button: Clears the text review box
* Created two tabs to switch between home and review page


We are on track according to our schedule.
