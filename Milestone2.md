# Milestone 2
Accomplished:
<br> 
- Added a time stamp for each review, this feature will be used later to delete reviews
- Added an upvote and downvote feature to the reviews, where users can cast their vote on a review. 
- Rearranging reviews based on upvote status using the Comparable protocol 

<br>
We decided to switch our database implementation, which was initially planned for milestone 2, to milestone 3. We are still on track to finish the app on time.
